Site state transitions
----------------------

1. Site states transition schema during install

created ->
install_initiated ->
   only if on prem provisioners:
      install_setting_plan ->
      instal_plan_set ->
install_provisioning ->
install_provisioned ->
install_deploying ->
  (if ok ) -> active
  (if failed during any of the stages) -> failed

2. Site states transition during uninstall

uninstall_in_progress ->
  (if ok ) -> created
  (if failed during any of the stages) -> failed


Progress indicator transitions
-------------------------------

in_progress ->
   failed
   or
   completed
